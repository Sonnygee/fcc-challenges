  <h3>Self-taught mathematician George Boole was born 200 years ago. He changed the way we see and experience the world today.</h3>
  <p>Boole was given his first lessons in mathematics by his father, a tradesman, who also taught him to make optical instruments. Aside from his father’s help and a few years at local schools, however, Boole was self-taught in mathematics. When his father’s business declined, George had to work to support the family. From the age of 16 he taught in village schools in the West Riding of Yorkshire, and he opened his own school in Lincoln when he was 20. During scant leisure time he read mathematics journals in the Lincoln’s Mechanics Institute. There he also read Isaac Newton’s Principia, Pierre-Simon Laplace’s Traité de mécanique céleste, and Joseph-Louis Lagrange’s Mécanique analytique and began to solve advanced problems in algebra.</p>
  <p>Boole submitted a stream of original papers to the new Cambridge Mathematical Journal, beginning in 1841 with his “Researches on the Theory of Analytical Transformations.” These papers were on differential equations and the algebraic problem of linear transformation, emphasizing the concept of invariance. In 1844, in an important paper in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, “On a General Method of Analysis,” for which he was awarded the Royal Society’s first gold medal for mathematics, he discussed how methods of algebra and calculus might be combined. Boole soon saw that his algebra could also be applied in logic.</p>
  <p>Boolean algebra reduces mathematical variables to either yes or no, true or false, on or off, or 0 or 1. It's an integral data type in computer programming languages, such as Pascal and Java, and is also part of JavaScript, which along with HTML and CSS is essential to the web, Objective-C, a primary programming language for apps, and SQL (structured query language), which is used for accessing databases.</p>
  <p>Logic is used in Engineering, Law, Philosophy, Computer Science, Mathematics and many other disciplines (in other words, “Logic is useful.”). Logic makes our electronic gadgets such as cellphones work. Logic is fun and interesting. If logic is useful, and fun and interesting, then everyone should study it. Therefore, everyone should study logic.
